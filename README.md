# ✈️ Flight Delays Analysis Using Python(Libraries)

This project explores and analyzes flight delay data using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Skypie. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to delays and to visualize meaningful patterns that could assist in predictive insights or operational improvements.

📊 Project Overview
Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience and financial impact. This analysis aims to:

Clean and preprocess flight data.

Explore delay patterns across airlines, airports, and time frames.

Visualize trends and outliers.

Uncover correlations between different features.

Use visual storytelling to draw actionable insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x

NumPy – For numerical operations.

Pandas – For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib – For basic data visualizations.

Seaborn – For enhanced and statistical plotting.

Skypie – (Assumed custom/industry library for flight data insights or simulation. Please update description if different.)

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive data analysis environment.

📌 Key Findings
Peak delays tend to occur during specific hours and seasons.

Certain airports consistently experience more delays.

Weather and carrier-specific issues contribute significantly to total delay time.

Visualization of delay patterns allows better operational forecasting.
