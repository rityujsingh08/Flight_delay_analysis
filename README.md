# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis using Python

This project explores and analyzes flight delay data using Python and popular data science libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Skypie**. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to delays and to visualize meaningful patterns that could assist in predictive insights or operational improvements.

## 📊 Project Overview

Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience and financial impact. This analysis aims to:

- Clean and preprocess flight data.
- Explore delay patterns across airlines, airports, and time frames.
- Visualize trends and outliers.
- Uncover correlations between different features.
- Use visual storytelling to draw actionable insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations.
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** – For basic data visualizations.
- **Seaborn** – For enhanced and statistical plotting.
- **Skypie** – (Assumed to be a custom or external library for flight data or simulation. Update if needed.)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data analysis environment.
